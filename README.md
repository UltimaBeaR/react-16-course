# react-16-course
Project i create from react-16 udemy course

Course url: https://www.udemy.com/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/

It's based on my asp.net core v2 minimal project template (with semantic-ui library excluded).
In the course there is a ejected create-react-app template approach being used though.

This project is a result of a passed chapter 10 (Burger Builder Project_ Accessing a Server)
