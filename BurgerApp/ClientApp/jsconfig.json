// This file helps Visual Studio Code's intellisense if current folder (ClientApp folder) is opened as root in VS Code.
// For instance, if this file exists, "find references" feature will work across different files (modules) whether these files are opened as tabs or not
// (only opened files will count in "find references" if this file is missing).
// This is some kind of javascript project file for VS Code.
